Since I don't have the full content of the original `src/pages/Index.tsx` file, I can't provide a complete replacement with all the original code intact. However, based on the AI's response, here's what I can infer about the changes needed:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { distributions, calculateMean, calculateSD, calculateMedian, calculateSkewness, calculateKurtosis } from '../lib/distributions';
import ManualDistribution from '../components/ManualDistribution';
// Other imports would be here

// Component definition and other code would be here

// Add this function for handling manual density drawing
const handleManualDensityDraw = (binIndex, value) => {
  const newBins = [...(distParams.bins || Array(20).fill(0))];
  newBins[binIndex] = value;
  setDistParams({ ...distParams, bins: newBins });
};

// In the render section, replace the manual distribution rendering with:
{selectedDist === 'manual' && (
  <div className="manual-density-container">
    <ManualDistribution 
      bins={distParams.bins || []}
      onChange={(newBins) => setDistParams({ ...distParams, bins: newBins })}
      height={200}
      width={400}
    />
  </div>
)}

// Rest of the component would continue here
```

However, this is incomplete without seeing the full original file. The AI's response suggests there might be references to a non-existent property 'r' that need to be removed, and there might be duplicate manual distribution options in a dropdown that need to be fixed.
